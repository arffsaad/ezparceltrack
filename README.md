# ezparceltrack
Track (read: scrape) parcel tracking info from Tracking.my. Displays current info in CLI.

The code is as simple as it gets. Uses requests-html to render the page and it's JS to ensure that the tracking info has loaded
Runs perfectly on python3.9.5. By right it should run well on python3.x.

Pre-requisites:
- requests-html module
